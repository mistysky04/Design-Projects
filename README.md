# Design-Projects
Welcome to my repository of Figma-based design projects! My portfolio website is currently under construction, but this repository hosts all links to current completed projects &amp; those actively being developed.

## WeLearn
WeLearn was the product of the 2024 cmd-f hackathon, where my team and I wanted to create a phone application that would allow students to tutor their peers on certain topics, while looking for tutors on others. It utilized MappedIn's API that is able to create a map of indoor areas so students would be able to find each other in the complicated inner workings of University Building layouts. We wanted to make the UI fun and inviting so students would be more likely to use it regularly, and track their progress as both learners and educators. All the character mascots seen in the mockup were SVG assets created by me using Inkscape (an opensource vector graphics editor).

## Personal Portfolio Website
I've always been a lover of video games and when deciding how to go about developing my personal portolio, I wanted to create something inspired by one of my favourite games. I thought it would be fun for a little game sequence to occur at the beginning when you enter the website, which will naturally lead the user to my portfolio where I'm presented as a "Cutiomon Gym Leader". All the assets shown below were created by me, except the small pixel art character that the user will control, as well as the map itself (excluding the buildings). I've had a lot of fun creating this portfolio, and I will be coding up the website itself using React in the near future. Since this portfolio is still under construction, access to the Figma is password protected.

## Shopify Storefront Design
This was a simple design created for a previous internship application to Shopify. The application itself asked what your Shopify storefront would consist of, so I decided to actually design it! I've been crocheting and crafting more generally ever since I could remember. I decided my ideal storefront would be me selling my personal creations based on some of my favourite shows and movies. All the items seen in the mockup were hand crafted by me! Since this was a very simple mockup, the prototype is quite plain, but I've still decided to include the Figma link in case I decide to expand on this project.
